An Android app used for assisting “micro-business” owners in the bookkeeping process. Bookkeeping Buddy allows sole-proprietors, especially those who make and sell tangible goods over the internet, to log and track their expenses and monitor their inventory. 

## Planned Features 
- Users can create categories for materials 
- Users can create templates for their finished products, allowing for fexibility when determining material costs for each finished product
- Users can specify materials costs and quantities
- Upon adding finished products into “inventory,” material quantities will be adjusted automatically based on each finished product’s respective “materials quantities” and materials costs for that item is calculated automatically 
- Data gathered from the application is used to generate graphs to show expenses, sales, and materials usage
- Data gathered will provide the user with what finished products they can create with their existing supplies
